# Verification of mbedTLS Deterministic Random Bits Generator

This project verifies the implementation of a deterministic random bits generator correct with respect to a functional spec, which is in turn transcribed from NIST SP 800-90A. The C source code is in the top level directory, while the verification is under `specs/`, and the report is under `paper/`.
